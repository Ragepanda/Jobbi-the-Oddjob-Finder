	<p> Currently my web app can create a new instance, and retrieve an index of instance ids. The other three criteria will be added in as methods in my ORM table class,
		labeled jobbiset.php. There will be added functionality to remove posts by id in response to the "report" button. The report button will also update the "reportCount" value
		in the table, and when the value is 5 or higher, the post will be deleted. Given that I have an exam tomorrow, I've decided to shelf off this functionality until a little 
		later, I hope you understand. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
		For the time being, I've demonstrated that I can load my database entries into Jobbi, and that I can create new ones in a RESTful style that
		tears down the posts and retrieves them from the database without reloading the page. I decided to use Jquery in my jobbi.js file to remove all posts from the
		DOM, to account for people from different IPs uploading. The finished product will limit the posts to a total of 25 on the page, which is why the teardown is important.
		
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Under the addRequest() method in Jobbi.js, I have an ajax method to send newly entered information to PHP, encoded using the .post jquery method. Right now,
		POST is the format used for passing new post info to PHP to generate a new table entry, this can be found in callback.php, which is linked to jobbiset.php, the 
		ORM file containing the a8_jobbi (database) methods. All parameters being sent by the $.post method are not mandatory, which means posts with some entries empty can be made.
		Here is the <a href=http://wwwp.cs.unc.edu/Courses/comp426-f14/jwoltz/a8/jobbi.html>link</a> to the main page. If you enter in your information, a new post will be made.
		The email is encapsulated in the database so that users cannot see it, when the project is fully completed, PHP will generate a message to the original poster via e-mail, using 
		the attached id.

	<p> Update: 12/5/14, 7:45PM. I showed the site to a friend, who then tried to do an input, and I found out that requests won't work if they exceed a certain length. I'll have it
		fixed for the final presentation, but I just wanted you to be aware of it as you test it.
