			The application I want to develop is an open request board for people who need a quick, one-time job done.
			In this design there would be two interfaces, one for people looking for things to do, in which they can offer their services, 
			and the other for requests. The design will be a straightforward posting setup where users can fill out a form, either as 
			a requester or as a serviceperson, after which their job/offer will be posted. There will be optional fields for pay and location. 
			People will be able to respond to ads by typing in a message into form that the posts will link to, which will then send the poster an 
			e-mail on the account they registered.
		</p>
		<p>
			My first stretch goal is to include a report option for requests that appear offensive or illegal in nature, and after a certain number of
			reports, the ad will be taken down. To prevent potential abuse I would only allow downvotes from a single IP address. At this point 
			I haven't decided as to whether I'm going to use a Bootstrap implementation or one of my own personal design. This assignment will involve
			a few javascript objects and a strong back end storage solution to store them, since this service would require that I keep on hand the email of
			all of the requesters/servicers. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Below is a CSS implementation of how I want my layout to look.
